# Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open a private vulnerability report at <https://github.com/Gabb-c/pokenode-ts/security>.

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions of Pokenode-ts to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
